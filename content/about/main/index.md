  Currently, I’m a data team lead at Fraym, a start-up that analyzes population change through satellite imagery and machine learning. I use this blog to share personal projects and things I’m learning about data analysis and visualization. As a self-taught coder and data analyst, I learned most of what I know from reading blogs and articles of random people on the internet who were kind enough to share their projects with the world. This blog is my attempt to give back to that community.

  - I work primarily in R (tidyverse mostly), QGIS and Figma. 
  - I’m not the world’s best coder so nothing I share here should be viewed as a “best practice”
  - Before moving into data analytics I studied Arabic and worked as a journalist in the Middle East
  - I live in Washington, DC with my wife and daughter
