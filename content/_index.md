subtitle: "I use data and maps to explain the world"
description: "Currently, I’m a data team lead at Fraym, a start-up that analyzes population change through satellite imagery and machine learning. I use this blog to share personal projects and things I’m learning about data analysis and visualization. As a self-taught R programmer and data analyst, I learned most of what I know from reading blogs and articles of random people on the internet who were kind enough to share their projects with the world. This blog is my attempt to give back to that community."
