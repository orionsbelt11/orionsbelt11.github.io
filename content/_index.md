description: "Currently, Iâ€™m a data team lead at Fraym, a start-up that analyzes population change through surveys, satellites, and machine learning. I write data-driven stories about foreign policy, sports, and pretty much anything I can put on a map. I also share the occasional how-to tutorial on R programming and data visualization."
